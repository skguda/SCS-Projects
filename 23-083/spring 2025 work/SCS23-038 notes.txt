Worked on current project since 2020.

Fourth year they are working on this project. Final year of data collection, client wants to wrap this project up.

Initial idea is that people either conform to conventilanl or organic production .Client's way is a mixed system. Take parts of both systems to create a new one

30 different treatments. Applying conventional or organic nutrients
4 different kinds of seeds. 

Applied a lot of carbon during the first year, and then put nitrogen back in the ground. 

Either planted crops in the fall or winter. 

40 different nutrients they are measuring (in soil, above soil, yield)

3 different pepper grinds. 

Wants some type of regression analysis done to the fourth year soil data. 


1. Wants to validate the analysis.
4 locations, 3 times the amount of data: soil data, climate data

Experiments are located in 3 locations of Indiana with different soil conditions. 

Look into a select few variables in the soil data for the 3 locations. (anything between 70-30 is good soil, and < 30 is best)
Measures the amount of carbon dioxide. 

6-8 max output variables that we can look at. Dependent variable is against the time. 

Always 2 sets of information (Spring measurement before fertilizer, fall measurement after fertlizer) Measure how much is left after the growing season. 

Wants visuals to be like the poster. 

Wants to see effect of cover crop over a season. If the cover crop has a positive effect on the amount of nutrients in the soil. How can we expect a increase or decrease for a crop. 

Compare spring vs spring or fall vs fall. 

Measure N2 in the beginning and the end. Apply cover crop in the middle. 

Wants to develop methodology to track change over the year. See if we are goign up or down. Ideally we would like to see the whole data, however a snapshot is acceptable.
