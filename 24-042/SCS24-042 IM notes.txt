Client: Dr.Erin Dunn
Attendees: Sumeeth, Antik, Chong, Xiyu Wang (Obs)

Background/Research Problem:
New faculty member at purdue, has a 1 year NIDCR where she proposes to do analysis to undestand exposure to advaersity and 2 outcomes of dental development and use polygenic risk scores based on brain disorders to look at these outcomes.

She had a data analyst and she only has 4 months left on this grant. She needs help preforming the analysis. All the data is collected, univariates are derived, she needs help running the models. 

She is looking for data analysis help, she needs someone to do the analysis

Has existing code from her lab, potential missing data. 

SCLMA is one piece of the analysis. SHe needs help running the models.  

What is SCLMA? How does it work? How does the data look like? 

Sample size: 700 - 1000
Variables: 2 outcomes, 5 exposure variables/constructs, 2 variables per construct

- Once she has the model and have the data collected, it isn't that hard to run the model into the computer. - Gu

Client has a plan to their data analysis and data. But the issue is that she doesn't have a data analyst to put the data into the code and do EDA / present the results.

In the case the client has the formulation set, it isn't that hard to run the code. 

How does the model look like? How does the data look like? 
- Until we see anything we can't do anything on behalf of her as her project sound like a project independent of the responsibilities of the SCS. 
- We could essentially make this a research posting. 

Dr.Craig and Dr.Ward offered options to her project. 

We are willing to give a hand, but not going to be data analysts without more sprcific pronlems to solve. 

Responsibilities 

Client: Will follow up with position description, share rmd file, and give materials on the SCLMA model.
