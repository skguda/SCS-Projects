SCS 24-064 Follow Up meeting: 
2/12/25
Attendees: Sumeeth, Chris Ghitta, Zoeanna Mayhook, Chong Gu

===========================================
Background: 
They emailed a lot of students to have a diverse sampling population

They are looking at the impact of case competition of first year student, to ensure that the students  likely don't have experience with competitions.
They are concerned with the finance components of case competitions
They have 76 respondents. 

Surver has 4 compoents: 
1. Demographics
2. Academic concepts
3. Behavorial Components
4. Finance / Ethics components
They have all the data, and while they have some rough idea for analysis however they need help with more formal analysis and statistical testing

The population participated in the same case competition. They didn't have any case competition experience before. 

It is a fairly clean sample. 

They took the SCS's advice to level the playing ground with the basleine for analysis and data storytelling. 

They took into consideration that some students have experience with case compatitions. In section 1 of the survey. 

For the likert scale questions which have 3 or more sections, the scores will be aggregated. 

The single item questions will be ordinal. 

The select all that apply questions will be converted into multiple binary

Zoe: They might consider the descriptive statistics but are open to the multiple binary outcomes. 

For the actual multiple choice: Ordinal -> Likert scale, Nominal -> Categorial variable

Open ended question: Unless you have ways of turning the data into characteorization ,can't analyze quantitatively

Can ignore the qualtative question.


========================================
Problem: 

For the analysis it depends on the specific research question. 

Suppose for one of the question, you might want to see how the factors impact the response would follow a regression method.

If they are interested in a pair of items relate to each other and if they are numerical like subscales, we could plot them in a scatter / jitter plot to show the correlations.

You can see if there is a linear or polynomial pattern. 

If they are interested in the relations between 2 categorical factors, to 2-way table analysis and get the chi-square test statistic. 

If multiple traits want to be analyzed (2 quant, 2 cat), can customize the scatter plots to show how the categorical variables compare to each other. 

Don't do formal analysis yet, visualize and do the EDA first and identify any raw patterns within the data itself. 

If they isolate a specific response and to see if they want to see the behaviours in the other factors, this will be a regression question. 

Regression needs to include everything to minimize the noise. 

If they want to see corr between 2 variables, use a scatter plot + 2 way table. In case they are interested in wether those correlations may vary with certain other factors, then a typical way would be to segregate the data (not a good idea due to low cardinality). 
However if they isolate the groups, do several pair wise comparisons assuming they have plenty of data. 

They need to come up with specific resarch questions, and we can do more thorough analysis. 

Zoe: They are considering regression on the responses

If they are checking a pre and post analysis then they need to put factors into the independent cariables. 

The clioent asked us to impose our subject matter knowledge into the project

If there are multiple likert scale in one question, we usually aggregate and treat as continupus. 

If it is single likert scale it would be ordinal. 

If it is independent variables, treat as categorical. Treating correlation between 2 likert scales would need poly correlate correlation assuming theyu are cut from the same latent. 

Likert scale by nature is univariate. 

Considering a likert scale in a model is dependent on the context. 

They want to finish this project by mid march. 

Gu: Identify a specific research question, and do the EDA with this researcvh question in mind. 

Will mine the data for a pattern, but we would have a hypothesis in mind when we take a look at the data itself. 

We don't need to look at all the variables, come up with the research questions using a few of the variables and we can analyze the data with these questions in  mind

Plotting the data tends to convey the story of the data better than numbers.
